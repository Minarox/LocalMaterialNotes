## Enhancements

- Highlight search terms in the title/content of the list tiles in the search view: [Highlightable](https://pub.dev/packages/highlightable) could work great for this, but if the text to highlight isn't in the first 3 lines then it is not shown.
- Better search: Improve the search to be more effective than the current `contains()`.
